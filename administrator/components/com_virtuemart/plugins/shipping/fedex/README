This PHP library provides an interface to FedEx's Ship Manager Direct API.  Using this
class you will be able to send and receive data to any of FedEx's Ship Manager Direct API
transaction types.  If you are looking for an easy way to track, ship, rate ... with FedEx
using PHP you have come to the right place.  If you are looking for a Perl version
we have that also on CPAN.

This library is an alternative to using the FedEx Ship Manager API ATOM product.
The main advantage is you will no longer need to install the JRE dependant API
provided by FedEx.  Instead, data is POST(ed) directly to the FedEx
transaction servers via the Internet.

When using this module please keep in mind FedEx will occasionally change some of the
transaction codes for their API.  This should not break existing code, but it is a good idea
to check out changes when possible.  I document all the changes in a "CHANGES" log.

To submit a transaction to FedEx's API server you must be registered with FedEx.  You also
must have a valid FedEx Account Number.  Once you are registered and have
an account you must send a subscribe() request to FedEx containing your FedEx account number
and contact information.  This request will provide you with a meter number.  The meter number
will be used to send live shipping transactions to FedEx.
There is an example of the subscribe() request below. 

FedEx has two API servers a live one for real transaction and a beta
for testing.  I will no longer be able to distribute the addresses of FedEx's APIs.
You should register with FedEx to obtain this information.  http://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/

If you are looking for consulting services relating to this module please contact Vermonster LLC
http://www.vermonster.com/contact/.  We can help ease the integration process and get up and
running quickly.

Tracking request do not require Account#/Meter#

You will need to subscribe to each server you intend to use.  FedEx will also require you
to send a batch of defined data to their live server in order to become certified for live
label creation.

Please refer to the FedEx documentation at http://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/
Here you will find more information about using the FedEx API.

Here is a sample Subscription Transaction

    #new object with account#
    $fed = new FedExDC('#########');

    $aRet = $fed->subscribe(
    array(
        1 => 'unique12345',
        4003 => 'John Doe',
        4008 => '123 Main St',
        4011 => 'Boston',
        4012 => 'MA',
        4013 => '02116',
        4014 => 'US',
        4015 => '6175551111',
    ));

    print_r($aRet);

This call will return a FedEx Meter number so you can use the FedEx API.  The meter number
will be referenced in field 498.  $aRet[498];  Or you can use the lookup function and pass a
field name:
# pass field name
echo $fed->lookup('meter_number');
